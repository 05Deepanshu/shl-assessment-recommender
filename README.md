SHL Assessment Recommender 🔍

A semantic search–based recommendation system that suggests the most relevant SHL assessments for a given job description using NLP embeddings and FAISS vector search.

Built with FastAPI, Sentence Transformers, and a modern UI, this project demonstrates end-to-end skills in data processing, machine learning, backend APIs, evaluation, and frontend integration.

- Features

 Semantic matching between job descriptions and SHL assessments

 NLP embeddings using sentence-transformers

 Fast similarity search with FAISS

 REST API built using FastAPI

 Evaluation using Recall@K

 Clean, modular project structure

🧠 How It Works

Assessment Catalog

A curated dataset of 134 SHL assessments stored in CSV format.

Text Embeddings

Each assessment is converted into a vector using a Sentence Transformer model.

Vector Indexing

FAISS indexes these embeddings for fast similarity search.

Query Processing

A job description is embedded and compared against the index.

Recommendation

Top-K most similar assessments are returned via API and shown in the UI.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/05deepanshu/shl-assessment-recommender.git
cd shl-assessment-recommender

2️⃣ Create & activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

- Generate Embeddings (One-time)
python backend/embeddings.py


This will create:

vector_store/index.faiss

vector_store/metadata.pkl

- Run the Backend API

uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
